Invariably every time Michael powers up his amplifier at the studio,
bits and pieces of Christian radio leak out, which we hear between
chords and outbursts of feedback.  One of the more common broadcasts
includes a recitation of the rosary.  Now listen: yamaka-wearing Michael is
not a card-carrying member of the sunday-morning-cannibalism phylum,
so it would seem to me that some significant truth is being

And at the same time, it has made me want to rock more than ever in my
life.  Don't know what I had to say back when wanting to be punk rock at
18.  In reality, punk rock should begin closer to 40yrs old.  More
experience, more frustration, more to be happy about, more to be pissed
about. All with less future options and nearing your half-life.  I mean,
the marginalization that comes with middle age inspires as much, if not
more, to rock out about than the isolation of youth.  More people should
be starting bands when they turn 35.

**********************************************************************


The year was 1987, and Christopher O'Grady was a second year graduate
student in high-energy physics at Cornell University.  As young men
are oft wont to do, he started a band with a like-minded postdoc and
another graduate student, influenced by the noisier side of rock and
roll with bands like Sonic Youth, Husker Du, and Flipper.  It's 20
years later, and now he does some combination of electronics, software
and accelerator physics for the Babar experiment.  He has 2 cars, 2
kids, and 2 mortgages, but the music continues, all released on a
small record label he runs with friends called 10GeV Records.


Q. So tell me about "Lardass".


A. Hmmm. B.B. King had a guitar named "Lucille", and Eric Clapton had
"Blackie", so I named mine "Lardass".  I carved it into the guitar
with a paring knife one day, and also wrote it out on one of those
adhesive Dymo labels.


Q. And whence the name 10GeV records?


A. A postdoc named Dave Besson and I were at Wilson Lab at Cornell and
we had been playing in a band with this guitar player who had been in
the L.A. punk band The Angry Samoans.  We found a drummer who was a
solid-state physics grad student named Brian Moeckly, and starting
practicing in this warehouse associated with Wilson Lab called the
10GeV annex.  10GeV was the center-of-mass collision energy of the
Cornell accelerator.  After a few years we put out a double 7"
(vinyl!) record and decided to name our little pseudo-label after that
practice space.  Interestingly, the collision energy of the Babar
experiment that I work on now is also 10GeV.  When the B Factory shuts
down in 2008 it will be the first time our label won't be associated
with an experiment at that energy.  I'm kinda bummed about that.
Brian, Dave and I are still all involved in music, although Dave is
now faculty at Kansas and Brian works for a superconductor firm in
Santa Barbara.


Q. How was the response to that first record?


A. We're pretty much small potatoes in the world of rock and roll, but
one kinda cool thing happened.  We had sent out a bunch of copies to
assorted press and radio, and I was at Wilson lab one day when a call
came in.  It was from some guy claiming to be phoning from Rolling
Stone who had some questions for me.  I thought it was a joke, but
fortunately I played along because it turned out to be legit.  They
actually wrote a few paragraphs about that record.  It's the issue
with Cindy Crawford on the cover.


Q. And what has the label been up to since then?


A. Well, we branched out and started putting out releases from some of
our friends who had bands that we liked.  We mostly send them out to
press and radio in the U.S., and some international.  We've put out
about 15 releases over the last 13 years.  We used to play clubs on
the east coast, some great places like CBGBs in New York and Maxwells
in New Jersey, but now we're mostly studio based.  Our last couple of
releases (done by myself and former physicist Michael Temkin) have
made it into the charts at a few college radio stations, even with no
promotion, so that's cool.  It is and always will be a huge money
sink, but it's a nice change from doing physics.


Q. Any other associations between the music and physics?


A. I guess it feels like alot of high-energy physicists abstractly
associate physics with music like Mozart, Bach, etc.  But, to me,
quantum mechanics and relativity are a helluva lot more like strange
guitar feedback.  There was this time in Ithaca when a band I was in
was playing at a club, and this one wilder song made me feel like
hanging upside down by my legs from the rafters while playing guitar,
so I did (the safety requirements at rock and roll clubs are different
than at DOE labs).  That's what the best physics feels like to me.
Interestingly, I've played rock with a bunch of physicists over the
years and, out of the trinity of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, none of
them has ever been interested in drugs.  Rightly or wrongly, I
attribute that to fact that everyone found that the world around us is
more than interesting enough all on its own.

vonnegut:


During the Vietnam War," he told an interviewer in 2003, "every
respectable artist in this country was against the war. It was like a
laser beam. We were all aimed in the same direction. The power of this
weapon turns out to be that of a custard pie dropped from a stepladder
six feet high."


**********************************************************************


The 20th release from San Francisco based 10GeV records.


With its noisier chaotic sounds, it targets the ills of modern society
with a focused, laser-like power.  As previous generations of artists
have discovered, this power turns out to be comparable to that of a
custard pie dropped from a six foot stepladder.  But what the hell.
Track 2 is the, uh, hit single.

it's a high mass xmas on the 405

it's jan 2 and i'm john xxiii
and i'm floating to the bottom of an inverted sea

we counting cards with our apostolic spies
i feel the rapture i feel the joy
and i cast you out

i'm sliding into home plate of my purgatory
where the sinners singing softly invoke robert e lee
i see the white light i see the heat
i see the angel legions shuffling their feet
i feel the rapture i feel the joy
and i cast you out

yeah yeah

(first slide, please)

this is marla stephens from fayetteville, arkansas. ms. stephens owned
a chevrolet malibu which she drove everyday to and from work, as well
as to her daughter's ballet classes on the weekends.  her home was 30
miles out of fayetteville, so she spent much of her driving time on
the highway. As a result of this and conservative driving habits,
ms. stephens, without realizing it, achieved the best average gas
mileage of anyone who ever drove a chevrolet malibu.

(next slide please, jake)

this is thomas mertz from huntsville, alabama.  mr. mertz was older
when he owned his 1973 chevrolet malibu, so he only drove it on
weekends to visit his son outside of birmingham.  the long highway
miles, coupled with warm temperatures and slower driving speeds meant
that mr. mertz held the record for best average gas mileage for a 1973
chevrolet malibu.

(next slide please, jake)

finally, rebecca lind from roanoke virginia.  rebecca was a 5th
generation descendent of civil war commander robert e. lee.  9 of
general lee's descendents drove 1973 chevrolet malibus, but of those,
ms lind had the best mileage.

there were circumstances
there was an incident
there were too many inputs
there were too many errors

it was the fourth quarter
and the cowboys were down by 11
when the defensive squad took the field

now, jd powers and associates had run simulations of this particular situation
and, mathematically, the cowboys had only a one in 35 chance of turning it around
but the fans were behind them, and together they looked towards heaven
raising their voices,
and this is what they sang

  o hanging aluminum foil strips
  o film reflections in foil
  o band standing on lazy susans
  o rearview mirror in theatre
  o strange "analog" lenses (as used in back-of-van window, maybe a sphere)
  o no stereotypical band shots
  o slide-show backlit cpo (hair) and will (no hair)
- second movement: 
  o many gas stations: filling up
  o slideshow appears in rearview mirror
  o burning slides in middle (like world-at-war bbc)
- third movement:
  o odometer rolling over
  o distinguish it from second part somehow (driving instead of gas-station)
  o slides speeding up
  o maybe band becomes part of the slides
