Hey there ,

This is Chris from Vertacyn Arc Materializer here.  Thanks for your reply about the possibility of booking a tour date for our band on April ??.  We have a number of possibilities for tour locations and hope it's OK if we take a few more days to figure out how to best fit the tour "puzzle pieces" together.  If you need an answer sooner than that please let me know and I'll do my best.

I will be in touch soon.

Thanks for your reply and for considering our band,

Hey there ,

It's very reasonable that you book based on draw. This is our first venture outside our SF Bay Area home where we have some following so I would expect our draw to be small, but that said:

- we have put thousands of dollars into online/radio promotion (most recent album promoted by tinderboxmusic.com, as well as on youtube/facebook).  we received radio play at dozens of college music stations and have tens of thousands of youtube views.
- our live performance is unusual/weird/intense, so there is a chance your audience might enjoy it (see https://www.vertarcmat.com/video)

But no worries if you think our act does not have a strong enough draw.  And thank you for considering us,
