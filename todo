Our third album.  Our previous albums have received good reviews and modest radio play at college stations across the country.  The album artwork and title ("Phlodd") are a riff on perfect computer-generated music.  We have hand-drilled a hole (flaw) through each CD/packaging and put a luggage-lock cable through it: our own tongue-in-cheek "digital-rights-management" (see artwork picture attached).  The lock/instructions will make it distinctive and easier for you to promote.  The instructions read: "To prevent unauthorized listening to this hi-fidelity audio recording place CD in included cardboard sleeve, aligning hole in disc with hole in cover.  Insert cable through hole and engage in lock.  You DRM key code is set to 000 by default.  You can personalize you code by depressing the red button while altering the combination, and we can collectively Imagine a world where someday this sort of shit isn't necessary."  In addition to the drilled hole each CD also has five hand-applied custom "inspection arrow" stickers initialed by band members highlighting the flaws introduced by the hole drilling.  We're doing the same lock-based analog-rights-management with the vinyl where we have added an extra lock-groove to prevent the needle from going into the drilled hole (vinyl unfortunately delayed for months because of supply-chain).
