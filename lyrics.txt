Sailing heart-ships thru broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright.
Tell me why, tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself,
When your old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while.
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile
Tell me why, tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself,
When your old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell,
blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? 
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground. 
What have we found? The same old fears.
Wish you were here.

You say the hill's too steep to climb 
Climbing. 
You say you'd like to see me try 
Climbing. 
You pick the place and I'll choose the time 
And I'll climb 
The hill in my own way. 
Just wait a while for the right day. 
And as I rise above the tree-line and the clouds 
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you've said today. 
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd 
Smiling. 
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round 
Frowning. 
And who's the fool who wears the crown? 
No doubt, 
In your own way 
And every day is the right day 
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow 
You look down, hear the sound of the faces in the crowd. 

**********************************************************************

Spent my days with a woman unkind,
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start,
Going to california with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me theres a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane,
Never let them tell you that theyre all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey,
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
Ill meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king;
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin to find a woman whos never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
that you are part of everything
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

Look around round
Look around round round
Look around

Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleepin
We could dream this night away.

But theres a full moon risin
Lets go dancin in the light
We know where the musics playin
Lets go out and feel the night.

Because Im still in love with you  (a7 sus4 / a7)
I want to see you dance again
Because Im still in love with you
On this harvest moon.

When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart.

But now its gettin late
And the moon is climbin high
I want to celebrate
See it shinin in your eye.

Because Im still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because Im still in love with you
On this harvest moon.

**********************************************************************

As I reach for a peach
Slide a line down behind a sofa in San Tropez
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand
Riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling
If you're alone, I'll come home

Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I'll gather my far flung thoughts together
Speeding away on a wind to a new day
If you're alone, I'll come home

And I'll pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Digging for gold in a hole in my hand
Open the book, take a look at the way things stand
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone
And if you're alone, I'll come home

if you close the door
the night could last forever
leave the sunshine out
and say hello to never

all the people are dancing 
and theyre having such fun
i wish it could happen to me

but if you close the door
id never have to see the day again

if you close the door
the night could last forever
leave the wine glass out
and drink a toast to never

oh someday i know someone will look into my eyes
and say hellooo
youre my very special one

but if you close the door
id never have to see the day again

dark party bars 
shiny cadillac cars
and the people on subways and trains
looking gray in the rain
as they stand disarrayed
all but people look well in the dark

and if you close the door
the night could last forever
leave the sunshine out
and say hello to never

all the people are dancing
and theyre having such fun
i wish it could happen to me

cause if you close the door
id never have to see the day again
id never have to see the day again

once more
id never have to see the day again

here i go

This is a story about a girl that I knew
She didn't like my songs and that made me feel blue
She said a big band is far better than you...

She don't rock'n'roll, she don't like it
She don't do the stroll, well she don't do it right
Well everything's wrong and my patience is gone
When I woke one morning and remembered this song
Kinda catchy

I hope that she will talk to me now and even allow me 
To hold her hand and forget that old band

I strolled around to her pad
Her light was off and that's bad
Her sister said that my girl was gone
"But come inside boy, and play, play, play me a song"
I said, "yeah...here i go..."
She's kinda cute don't you know?
That after awhile of seeing her smile I knew we could make it
Make it in style

So now I got all I need
She and I are in love, we've agreed
She likes this song and my others too
So now you see my world is...
Cos of this tune...what a boon this tune!
I tell ya soon we'll be lying in bed, happily wed 
And I won't think of that girl and what she said...

Wake up mama, turn your lamp down low
Wake up mama, turn your lamp down low
Have you got the nerve to drive papa McTell from your door

My mother died and left me reckless, my daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
Mother died and left me reckless, daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
No, I'm not good lookin', I'm some sweet woman's angel child

You're a mighty mean woman, to do me this a-way
You're a mighty mean woman, to do me this a-way
Going to leave this town, pretty mama, going away to stay

I once loved a woman, better than I ever seen
I once loved a woman, better than I ever seen
Treat me like I was a king and she was a doggone queen

Sister, tell your Brother, Brother tell your Auntie, Auntie, tell your Uncle,
Uncle tell my Cousin, Cousin tell my friend
Goin' up the country, Mama, don't you want to go?
May take me a fair brown, may take me one or two more

Big Eighty left Savannah, Lord, and did not stop
You ought to saw that colored fireman when he got that boiler hot
Reach over in the corner, hand me my travelin' shoes
You know by that, I got them Statesboro blues

Sister got 'em, daddy got 'em
Brother got 'em, mama got 'em
Woke up this morning, we had them Statesboro blues
I looked over in the corner,
Grandpa and grandma had 'em too.

Did I see you down
In a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there
At the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain.

Did she wake you up
To tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up,
Let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man.

Did I see you walking with the boys
Though it was not hand in hand?
And was some black face
In a lonely place
When you could understand?

Did she wake you up
To tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up,
Let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man.

Will I see you give
More than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past
Will we lose our grasp
Or fuse it in the sun?

Did she wake you up
To tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up,
Let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man.

(nominally in e-flat, but can do in d)

Its automatic when i
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go

Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Lets get together and
Do it again

(4th) Makes your (5th) nighttimes warm and (4th) out of sight (5th)

Been so long

Well Ive been thinking bout
All the places weve surfed and danced and
All the faces weve missed so lets get
Back together and do it again

found in hell their resting place
they have made their bed

you're gonna need somebody on your bond
when it's way past midnight
and death comes creeping in your room
you're gonna need somebody on your bond

lord i heard jesus say
come over to me and rest
i found a way for me to lie down
i laid upon his breast

when i was a gambling man
noone could hold my bond
fell down on my knees and prayed
jesus gonna go my bond

things about coming my way

ain't got no job

my baby left me
on a snowy day
she stole my children
and ran away

if i had a dollar
i'd have my fun
i'd buy me some whisky
and make myself dumb

there'll be a chicken
in every pot
but if you look in mine boy
you'll see there's not

born a poor young country boy mother nature's son

I will bring anything for three
With a dusty smile and a loaded gun
You ask me again, "What's in it for me?"
Robbing banks until we come undone

Painted red, our hands are white
I've never seen this place before
Sailing through, we're on our way
Through and through each bolted door

Driving us down
Bullets chase and we run
Any day we'll skip town
They won't ever hear us come
Driving us down
Bullets chase and we run
Any day we'll skip town
They won't ever hear us come

Won't you help me out?
Oh won't you please help me figure it all out?
We've cut ourselves open a hundred times
We've cut ourselves open a hundred times
But we're not out of ammo yet
But we're not out of ammo yet

Oh now no
Won't you help me out?
Oh won't you please help me figure it all out?
