next album:
- morse code message
- clear album and cover (no text)
- lottery scratcher cover
- multi-view cover (like postcard) done by b surfers
- squares (unfoldable). or more complex structure (cube, tetrahedron): use the clear album as skylite (others have created a building)

next album: ious&ufos, blackrock is going to short us, take it down, all that breathing is starting to pay off, i think of nothing and therefore you are, rancho santa fe, mr. sleep

Invariably every time Michael powers up his amplifier at the studio,
bits and pieces of Christian radio leak out, which we hear between
chords and outbursts of feedback.  One of the more common broadcasts
includes a recitation of the rosary.  Now listen: yamaka-wearing Michael is
not a card-carrying member of the sunday-morning-cannibalism phylum,
so it would seem to me that some significant truth is being
communicated (there are no coincidences).  - ankle, the mimic

And at the same time, it has made me want to rock more than ever in my
life.  Don't know what I had to say back when wanting to be punk rock at
18.  In reality, punk rock should begin closer to 40yrs old.  More
experience, more frustration, more to be happy about, more to be pissed
about. All with less future options and nearing your half-life.  I mean,
the marginalization that comes with middle age inspires as much, if not
more, to rock out about than the isolation of youth.  More people should
be starting bands when they turn 35.

**********************************************************************


The year was 1987, and Christopher O'Grady was a second year graduate
student in high-energy physics at Cornell University.  As young men
are oft wont to do, he started a band with a like-minded postdoc and
another graduate student, influenced by the noisier side of rock and
roll with bands like Sonic Youth, Husker Du, and Flipper.  It's 20
years later, and now he does some combination of electronics, software
and accelerator physics for the Babar experiment.  He has 2 cars, 2
kids, and 2 mortgages, but the music continues, all released on a
small record label he runs with friends called 10GeV Records.


Q. So tell me about "Lardass".


A. Hmmm. B.B. King had a guitar named "Lucille", and Eric Clapton had
"Blackie", so I named mine "Lardass".  I carved it into the guitar
with a paring knife one day, and also wrote it out on one of those
adhesive Dymo labels.


Q. And whence the name 10GeV records?


A. A postdoc named Dave Besson and I were at Wilson Lab at Cornell and
we had been playing in a band with this guitar player who had been in
the L.A. punk band The Angry Samoans.  We found a drummer who was a
solid-state physics grad student named Brian Moeckly, and starting
practicing in this warehouse associated with Wilson Lab called the
10GeV annex.  10GeV was the center-of-mass collision energy of the
Cornell accelerator.  After a few years we put out a double 7"
(vinyl!) record and decided to name our little pseudo-label after that
practice space.  Interestingly, the collision energy of the Babar
experiment that I work on now is also 10GeV.  When the B Factory shuts
down in 2008 it will be the first time our label won't be associated
with an experiment at that energy.  I'm kinda bummed about that.
Brian, Dave and I are still all involved in music, although Dave is
now faculty at Kansas and Brian works for a superconductor firm in
Santa Barbara.


Q. How was the response to that first record?


A. We're pretty much small potatoes in the world of rock and roll, but
one kinda cool thing happened.  We had sent out a bunch of copies to
assorted press and radio, and I was at Wilson lab one day when a call
came in.  It was from some guy claiming to be phoning from Rolling
Stone who had some questions for me.  I thought it was a joke, but
fortunately I played along because it turned out to be legit.  They
actually wrote a few paragraphs about that record.  It's the issue
with Cindy Crawford on the cover.


Q. And what has the label been up to since then?


A. Well, we branched out and started putting out releases from some of
our friends who had bands that we liked.  We mostly send them out to
press and radio in the U.S., and some international.  We've put out
about 15 releases over the last 13 years.  We used to play clubs on
the east coast, some great places like CBGBs in New York and Maxwells
in New Jersey, but now we're mostly studio based.  Our last couple of
releases (done by myself and former physicist Michael Temkin) have
made it into the charts at a few college radio stations, even with no
promotion, so that's cool.  It is and always will be a huge money
sink, but it's a nice change from doing physics.


Q. Any other associations between the music and physics?


A. I guess it feels like alot of high-energy physicists abstractly
associate physics with music like Mozart, Bach, etc.  But, to me,
quantum mechanics and relativity are a helluva lot more like strange
guitar feedback.  There was this time in Ithaca when a band I was in
was playing at a club, and this one wilder song made me feel like
hanging upside down by my legs from the rafters while playing guitar,
so I did (the safety requirements at rock and roll clubs are different
than at DOE labs).  That's what the best physics feels like to me.
Interestingly, I've played rock with a bunch of physicists over the
years and, out of the trinity of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, none of
them has ever been interested in drugs.  Rightly or wrongly, I
attribute that to fact that everyone found that the world around us is
more than interesting enough all on its own.

During the Vietnam War," he told an interviewer in 2003, "every
respectable artist in this country was against the war. It was like a
laser beam. We were all aimed in the same direction. The power of this
weapon turns out to be that of a custard pie dropped from a stepladder
six feet high."


**********************************************************************


The 20th release from San Francisco based 10GeV records.


With its noisier chaotic sounds, it targets the ills of modern society
with a focused, laser-like power.  As previous generations of artists
have discovered, this power turns out to be comparable to that of a
custard pie dropped from a six foot stepladder.  But what the hell.
Track 2 is the, uh, hit single.

this is marla stephens from fayetteville, arkansas. ms. stephens owned
a chevrolet malibu which she drove everyday to and from work, as well
as to her daughter's ballet classes on the weekends.  her home was 30
miles out of fayetteville, so she spent much of her driving time on
the highway. As a result of this and conservative driving habits,
ms. stephens, without realizing it, achieved the best average gas
mileage of anyone who ever drove a chevrolet malibu.

(next slide please, jake)

this is thomas mertz from huntsville, alabama.  mr. mertz was older
when he owned his 1973 chevrolet malibu, so he only drove it on
weekends to visit his son outside of birmingham.  the long highway
miles, coupled with warm temperatures and slower driving speeds meant
that mr. mertz held the record for best average gas mileage for a 1973
chevrolet malibu.

(next slide please, jake)

finally, rebecca lind from roanoke virginia.  rebecca was a 5th
generation descendent of civil war commander robert e. lee.  9 of
general lee's descendents drove 1973 chevrolet malibus, but of those,
ms lind had the best mileage.

S: What's all this about Saigon Kick, Chris?
C: That's an excellent question, Steve, I'm glad you asked.
   Saigon Kick was an early 90's hair metal band that formed in Miami
S: I can't recall any songs by them off the top of my head
C: They had a hit single Love Is On The Way from their second album titled The Lizard
S: Are they still around today?
C: They broke up around 2001, but I think that was unrelated to 9/11, so
   just a coincidence.  They reunited in 2012 to play some shows in Florida, NY and
   Las Vegas.
S: That's good to know Chris, thanks for filling me in.
C: No problem Steve, it's important to keep expanding your horizons.

it's jan 2 and i'm john XXIII
and i'm floating to the bottom of an inverted sea

we split the aces and we came up high
we're counting cards with our apostolic spies
i feel the rapture i feel the joy
and i cast you out

i'm sliding into homeplate of my purgatory
where the singers singing softly invoke robert e lee
i see the white light i see the heat
i see the angel legions shuffling their feet
i feel the rapture i feel the joy
and i cast you out

fail

(first verse)

There was talk of a rival
When the hammer came down
And the CEO happily danced
Back in from the ledge

The deal had been whispered
In the halls of high finance
And they shut it all down
Because there was nothing left

(chorus)

Down the drain
Once again
And the bosses pivot
Hunting for new prey
Acetylsalicylic (solid silver tripping) acid (fucking, selling)
acetylsupersonicsalyliccyberacid
acetylpsilocybinsalicylictrippingacid
Won't make this go away

(second verse)

rumours flew the end was nigh
swift mercy would end the pain
and following after the only brave choice

take the gold parachute or seek absolution
coward or hero choose the least of two evils
the least of pain ... or (merciful) abuse

i told you to enunciate
i told you to enunciate

i'd like to stand up and testify down in
rancho santa fe
know that i am god among you
you see a gateway i am the gateway

and if your hand should cause you to stumble
cut it off, cut it off: i say
better maimed than is to rot
down in rancho santa fe, hey

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me;

You prepare a banquet before me
in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

treading water, impending rapture
in a shit stained suit
you say cream soda? i say SHASTA!
dig it, huh

transmutate
pious and devout
the loop remains the same
and i will materialize/instantiate/incarnate
i am the incarnation

so now is the time for rancor
now is the time for targetted ads

*The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside still waters.
He restores my soul.
He leads me in paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.
*Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
*I will fear no evil,
*for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.
*You prepare a table before me
*in the presence of my enemies;
*you anoint my head with oil;
*my cup overflows.
*Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
*all the days of my life,
and I shall dwell in the house of THE LORD forever

i pick 8 straight losers in a 7 day week
now i no longer see straight and i no longer speak
i shorted all of the nikkei and half of the dow
i need 8 more dollars and i need it now
i had the clerk at the drug store give me all of her drugs
and now im sinking deeper in the back of the country club
and though you will find it's been a slow news week
in the end i remain yours truly
